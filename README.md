# hyperskill-python-hangman
### My Hangman project as part of the Hyperskill Jetbrains Academy Python Developer course.

**Project Number:** #5

**About:** Hangman game where the player has to guess a word, letter by letter, in a limited number of attempts. The program allows the player to replay the game multiple times or exit the game. Each time the program picks a word randomly from a predefined list. The program analyzes user's input for the correctness and displays an appropriate message for a different error case (the player did not enter a single character, the player did not enter an ASCII lowercase letter, the player already tried guessing this letter unsuccessfully). The player has to guess the word in 8 attempts, however, the attempts count is only reduced if the player enters a single ASCII lowercase letter for the first time, and it is not found in the word.

**Learning Outcomes:** Along with doing the project itself and finding solutions to numerous problems, I was learning more about using conditional statements, functions, loops, lists, handling errors, and processing user input in Python. I learnt to utilize tuples and sets, and understand when is it better to use one of them instead of lists. I have also gained knowledge about the Random module, and that it only generates pseudo-random numbers. This project also allowed me to use my skills of planning and developing a more complex program from scratch and slowly adding more functionality.
