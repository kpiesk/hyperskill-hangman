# hyperskill-python-hangman
### My Hangman project as part of the Hyperskill Jetbrains Academy Python Developer course.

**Project Number:** #5

**About:** Hangman game where the player has to guess a word, letter by letter, in a limited number of attempts. The program allows the player to replay the game multiple times or exit the game. Each time the program picks a word randomly from a predefined list. The program analyzes user's input for correctness, and displays an appropriate message for a different error case (player did not enter a single character, player did not enter a ASCII lowecase letter, player already tried guessing this letter unsucsessfully). The player has to guess the word in 8 attemps, however the attemps count is only reduced if the player enters a single ASCII lowercase letter for the first time, and it is not found in the word.
